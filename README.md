## ⚡ Technical Overview

This project primarily serves as a technical playground where I can take time to explore and refine my development practices. My objective is to make thoughtful technical choices while deepening my expertise with the technologies involved.

Beyond its core functionality, this savings application embodies my development philosophy: emphasizing quality, maintainability, and sustainable code. It stands as both a reflection of my current capabilities and my approach to web development.

The rise of AI has significantly democratized access to technical knowledge and made troubleshooting development issues more approachable.

Nevertheless, AI is a powerful tool, not a replacement for critical thinking. I embrace it as an invaluable development companion while maintaining full ownership of my architectural and technical decisions.

**The technical implementation reflects these core principles through:**

- 📱 **Mobile-First Approach** - Optimized UX design prioritizing mobile experience
- 🐳 **Containerized Development** - Dockerized environment for consistent development and deployment
- ⚡ **Modern Frontend Stack** - Symfony UX (Turbo, Stimulus) for enhanced user experience
- 🔍 **Code Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive linting with PHPStan, Rector and StyleLint
- 🧪 **Testing Suite** - Unit and functional tests with PHPUnit
- 🚀 **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## ✨ Key Features

- 💰 **Dual Pool Management** - Separate tracking of discretionary spending money and monthly savings provisions
- 🏦 **Multi-Account Support** - Centralized management of multiple savings accounts and financial pools  
- 📋 **Fund Allocation** - Manual classification between spending funds and annual expense provisions
- 🎯 **Personal Project Budgeting** - Allocate portions of spending money to specific personal projects to track available funds  
- 📊 **Financial Pool Visualization** - Clear dashboard showing both spending and saving balances with progress tracking
